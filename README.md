- Hi, I’m Zachary Wilt.
- I’m currently learning the fundamentals of Python, as well as Full Stack Web Development. Though I'm just through my first year in programming, I have always had a desire to create new things, from
  dining room tables in the wood shop to new music in the home studio. 
- I’m looking to collaborate on any projects related to the coffee industry, 
  especially reccomendation algorithms. 
- You can find me on Twitter!
